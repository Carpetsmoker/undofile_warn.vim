The 'undofile' is a great feature, and I use it a lot. However, one annoyance
is that it's very easy to accidentally undo changes that I did the last time I
opened the file; which may be 2 minutes ago, an hour ago, last week, or a
year ago.  
So what would happen is that sometimes I would accidentally undo changes from
ages ago.

This plugin fixes that by showing a warning.

I originally posted this as [an answer on vi Stack Exchange](http://vi.stackexchange.com/q/2115/51),
which also has some other solutions to the same problem.

See `:help undofile-warn` for the full documentation.
