*undofile_warn.txt* Warn when using the undofile.

INTRODUCTION                                                   *undofile-warn*

The 'undofile' is a great feature, and I use it a lot. However, one annoyance
is that it's very easy to accidentally undo changes that I did the last time I
opened the file; which may be 2 minutes ago, an hour ago, last week, or a
year ago.
So what would happen is that sometimes I would accidentally undo changes from
ages ago.

This plugin fixes that by showing a warning.

I originally posted this as an answer on vi Stack Exchange, which also has
some other solutions to the same problem:

MAPPINGS                                              *undofile-warn-mappings*

This plugin overwrites the |u| and |CTRL-R| mappings:
>
        nmap u     <Plug>(undofile-warn-undo)
        nmap <C-r> <Plug>(undofile-warn-redo)
<
You can prevent this by setting *g:undofile_warn_no_map* to 1.

OPTIONS                                                *undofile-warn-options*

*g:undofile_warn_mode*                                   (Boolean, default: 1)

        0   Show a warning for a second but don't actually change behaviour.
        1   Show a warning and do nothing on the first |u| press, confirm with
            pressing |u| again.
        2   Ask for explicit confirmation
